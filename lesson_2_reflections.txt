Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: It creates a structure where you can store your commits for the files you're working on.  Doing this would allow us to manage files for different projects.  

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A:  The staging area is where the user groups files to be committed together.  This allows you to pick and choose which files you want to commit to the repository.
