Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: You want to use a remote repository when you wish to share your work with other people.  You would do this if you're collaberating with
people or you want to ask for help.  


Q:Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: So that Git doesn't update it when your code isn't ready to be presented yet.
